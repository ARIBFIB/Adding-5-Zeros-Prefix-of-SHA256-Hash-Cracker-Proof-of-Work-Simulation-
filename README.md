# Adding-5-Zeros-Prefix-of-SHA256-Hash-Cracker-Proof-of-Work-Simulation-
A Python-based proof-of-work simulator that uses SHA-256 hashing to find a nonce (number) such that the resulting hash begins with five leading zeros. This mimics the mining process used in blockchain technology to validate data blocks.
