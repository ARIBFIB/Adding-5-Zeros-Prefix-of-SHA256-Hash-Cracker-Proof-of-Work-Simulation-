# Adding-5-Zeros-Prefix-of-SHA256-Hash-Cracker-Proof-of-Work-Simulation-
A Python-based proof-of-work simulator that uses SHA-256 hashing to find a nonce (number) such that the resulting hash begins with five leading zeros. This mimics the mining process used in blockchain technology to validate data blocks.

Nice! You’ve written a simple **proof-of-work style** hash cracker that looks for a SHA-256 hash starting with `"00000"` by incrementing a nonce — very cool!

Here’s how you can structure your GitHub project:

# SHA-256 Hash Cracker (Proof-of-Work Simulation)

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates the concept of **proof-of-work** using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. It continuously hashes a given string with an increasing integer (nonce) until a hash is found that starts with five leading zeros.

## 💡 What is Proof-of-Work?

Proof-of-work is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain systems like Bitcoin. It requires participants (miners) to solve a computational puzzle, which involves finding a number (nonce) that, when hashed with some data, produces a hash with certain properties (e.g., leading zeros).

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. A long prefix string is defined.
2. A counter (`i`) starts at 0.
3. In a loop, the string `prefix + i` is hashed using SHA-256.
4. The loop continues until the hash begins with `"00000"`.
